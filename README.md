### Hi, I'm Dave

Mobile & full-stack developer with a background in native iOS (Swift/SwiftUI) and Android (Kotlin/Compose), backend services (AWS, GraphQL, C#), and SDK design.

Currently building **[Pare](https://github.com/Dave-London/Pare)** — a suite of 9 open-source MCP servers that give AI coding agents structured access to developer tools: git, test runners, linters, build tools, npm, Docker, Cargo, Go, and Python.

**Pare by the numbers:**
- 62 tools across 9 servers
- 1,400+ tests (unit, integration, and fidelity testing)
- Cross-platform CI (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Zero config — just `npx @paretools/git`

Published as [@paretools](https://www.npmjs.com/org/paretools) on npm.
